## Post formatting

Example of a post:

```console
---
layout: post
title: "Hello, World! program"
link: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program"
canonical: "wikipedia.org"
tags: [hello, world, wikipedia.org]
excerpt: "Hello world"
comments: true
---
```

Note that the last tag is the canonical url which will be removed when printing tags.
